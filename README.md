# Bond Valuation Assignment

Every Monday morning the portfolio management desk receives a fresh file with bond positionsâ€”some already held, some under review as potential investments. Before the weekly investment meeting, these positions must be valued consistently so managers can compare them fairly. 

This solution guarantees the accurate valuation of bonds record from a structured and correct CSV file, returning the computed data either in JSON or in CSV format. Furthermore, an exception handling system enables users to track errors in the parsing and calculation processes to their root.


## Features

- CSV Bond Records Parsing
- Bond Present Value Calculation
- Error Tracking to Root Cause
- Output in JSON or CSV Format
